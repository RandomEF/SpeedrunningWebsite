                Some glitches aren't so simple, though. Just to perform one glitch in a full run can take an exceptionally long time. The incorrect execution can lead to a full system crash or just a simple run restart. The run restart will be easier in the beginning, but for some, 3000 hours of practice to just keep coming to a restart because of one glitch can be disheartening. So much so, that they quit games altogether. Mistakes just keep happening. But what if you wanted to know what the theoretical limit is, without all the mistakes?

                If you have watched speedruns before, TAS is probably an acronym you've come across in the past. It stands for Tool-Assisted Speedrun. These aren't meant to compare with human runs, but just to prove what a 'mistake-less' run would look like. They would also include glitches too precise to be performed by humans in real runs. These are still performed by a human, but on an emulator. This allows for tools like:

                <p>
                    In a game, each image on screen is a display of a frame, a current moment in time that the game is processing. The image itself can also be called a frame. Each frame has processing done by the computer that is repeated on every frame, unless there is a special event such as a loading zone or cutscene. Processing includes processing collisions between objects, physics movement, and everything else that a game does. By controlling when the game moves onto the next frame, the person controlling the emulator is able to input anything they want and pay attention to any changes in the world or RAM of the game.

                <p>
                    Emulators also come with the ability to emulate controller/keyboard/mouse inputs, and since they are emulating it, one can put in the exact numbers for the input in either integer or decimals, depending on what the game expects them to be.

                <p>
                    This allows the user to view how the memory of the game changes in real time, giving glitch hunters a useful insight into places that they can break the game, while also understanding how the game may work behind the scenes.

                <p>
                    Certain memory viewers are also memory editors, and hence allow the user to edit certain values of variables, allowing further testing of certain bugs.

                <h3 id="SS">Save states</h3>
                <p>
                    Save states allow the player to continuously try a certain section extremely quickly. This enables one to test different inputs very easily and makes it much easier to brute force a section. This especially helps if you are trying to make an accurate and near-perfect TAS because the perfect route may not have been created yet and it would be up to you to find out what the best and fastest route is.

                It can take many weeks to be able to replicate a TAS run, but with enough practice, one can take the title of world record. Even then, you're not finished. Maybe your record will stand for a long time, or maybe, someone else will try to take it. That's why, even after getting the record, you must keep pushing, keep going. Your title could be gone in an instant by new routes or techniques, or simply more optimized movement and execution. That's why speedrunners are just as amazing as speedcubers or trick shots. At heart, it's all about practice and patience.
