            <h2 class="Headings">Categories</h2>
            <p>
                Game developers will advertise “This game has over 20 hours of gameplay.” But the sad and brutal truth is, in most categories, <span class="Speedrunning">speedrunning</span> can stretch the human limit and get 20 hours to just under an hour in some cases, maybe even minutes or a few seconds. The exact times vary for each category and game.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are typically 3 categories that can be applied to almost every game. These are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Any%</li>
                <li>100%, also usually Max%</li>
                <li>Low%</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Any% is usually the most popular category for most games with its only requirement being beating the game as fast as possible. You don't have to do the full game.
            </p>
            <p>
                100% involves beating the game as fast as possible, while getting every single item in the game. This can differ from Max% in certain games. This is usually because the game has a built in percentage tracker, like Hollow Knight, and it becomes possible to exceed the standard 100% in the game and go beyond. In Hollow Knight, it is possible to go to 112% if you include everything in the game. Max% may also be used when the standard 100% is unattainable, usually due to <a href="#CategoryExtensions">Category Extensions</a>, which we will go on later.
            </p>
            <p>
                The opposite of Max% is Low% which requires you to beat the game as fast as possible while collecting the lowest number of items. This ends up in a run, which is could be like a snail race than anything else. For the Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, the Low% run stands at 24 hours, 59 mins, and 52 seconds. Certainly not anything speedy.
            </p>
            <p>Other typical categories include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Glitchless - No <a href="Glitches.html">glitches</a> are allowed in this category</li>
                <li>No Major Glitches - The use of major glitches are not allowed (the community decides what is considered a major glitch, check the rules of the game to see what they are)</li>
                <li>Inbounds - the bounds of a game is the world the developers have made and intended to be used and this category limits you to that world</li>
                <li><span class="tooltipMaster">Out of Bounds<span class="tooltip">
                    <img src="outofboundsD2.png" alt="View out of bounds in Destiny 2" width="1920" height="1080" style="max-width: 1920; width:100%">
                    Viewing into the Out of Bounds space in Destiny 2
                </span></span> - this category aims to break out of the world and use elements not intended to be accessed by the player and hence, elements outside of the game bounds are allowed to be used by the runner</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <hr>

            <h3 id="CategoryExtensions">Category Extensions</h3>
            <p>
                These are extra smaller categories that are done for different games, and they are very rarely applicable for other games. Some of these can be joke categories that are still recognised by the community and highly game specific. Even games in the same series may not have the same category extensions. For example, Super Mario Odyssey has these as its main categories:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Any%</li>
                <li>World Peace</li>
                <li>Dark Side</li>
                <li>Darker Side</li>
                <li>All Moons</li>
                <li>100%</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Meanwhile, these are its category extensions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>124 Moons</li>
                <li>All Captures</li>
                <li>All Coin Stacks</li>
                <li>All Death Animations</li>
                <li>All Story Moons</li>
                <li>All Moon Rock Moons</li>
                <li>All Moons NPG</li>
                <li>All Music</li>
                <li>All Purple Coins</li>
                <li>All Signs</li>
                <li>All Sub Areas</li>
                <li>Damageless</li>
                <li>Darker Side Dupes</li>
                <li>Dark Side Extras</li>
                <li>Festival%</li>
                <li>Koopa Freerunning RTA</li>
                <li>Maximum Unique Moon Dump</li>
                <li>Minimum Captures Any%</li>
                <li>Moon Cave</li>
                <li>Moon List Any%</li>
                <li>Nipple%</li>
                <li>Postgame Collectibles</li>
                <li>Star%</li>
                <li>Talkatoo%</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-style: italic; font-size:small">You have no idea how long that took to write up...</p>
            <p>That was 24 categories, which pales in comparison to other games. <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/portal_category_extensions">Portal ↗</a> has 32 category extensions, while <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/super_metroid_category_extensions">Super Metroid ↗</a> has 36 category extensions. <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/streets_of_rage_4">Streets of Rage 4 ↗</a> has well over 140 possible combinations, since there is a leaderboard for every single character, difficulty, and relevant version of the game.</p>
